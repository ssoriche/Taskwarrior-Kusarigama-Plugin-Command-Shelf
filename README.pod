    $ task-kusarigama add Command::Shelf

    # Shelf all tasks in the Lazy-List project

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sometimes projects aren't just put on the back burner, they're entirely put on
hold. For these times the C<shelf> command sets a C<shelved> C<uda> allowing
those tasks to be filtered out.

Without specifying C<get> or C<put> the C<shelf> command defaults to C<put>.

The C<shelf> commands work with any filtering that is supported by
L<Taskwarrior|http://taskwarrior.org/>.
